# Fish Species Image Classification

This project focuses on classifying fish species using deep learning techniques. It utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras to accurately identify different types of fish from images.

## Dataset

The dataset used is sourced from a large-scale fish dataset available on Kaggle. It contains images of various fish species, including:

- Hourse Mackerel
- Black Sea Sprat
- Sea Bass
- Red Mullet
- Trout
- Striped Red Mullet
- Shrimp
- Gilt-Head Bream
- Red Sea Bream
- ## Features

- Data preprocessing and augmentation using TensorFlow's ImageDataGenerator.
- Neural network built using the Sequential model from Keras.
- Performance evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## Results

The trained model will generate performance metrics such as:

- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report
